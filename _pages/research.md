## Somatic cell totipotency in plant regeneration
<div style="text-align: justify">
Somatic embryonic differentiation and plant regeneration is a developmental re-establishment process of somatic cells transforming to the embryogenesis pathway, an in vitro pathway and manifestation of plant asexual reproduction, and a unique phenomenon of plant developmental process. The mechanism of regulation of sexual differentiation and asexual reproduction in isolated embryos is considered as one of the very important scientific puzzles. At the same time, this biological process is an important link and foundation for crop cell and genetic engineering, asexual fast propagation, genetic fixation and mutation screening of excellent germplasm, and artificial seeds, which are the constraints and prominent shortcomings in the development of biotechnology breeding. In the process of tissue culture, cell and genetic engineering and other biotechnology applications in many crops, it is not yet possible to fundamentally regulate and control the process of somatic cell embryonic differentiation and plant regeneration with high efficiency and precision, which largely restricts the application of crop cell and genetic engineering in future biobreeding. Therefore, in this complex and coordinated process, the precise regulation mode of different embryonic differentiation fates and developmental directions of isolated cells needs to be resolved urgently, in which little is known about how cell populations in isolated tissues initiate differentiation and communication and interaction, which is worthy of in-depth research and exploration.

## Fine-tuning of economic traits in soybean
<div style="text-align: justify">
Seed storability in crops has been a major concern for propagation, global grain preservation and food security. However, molecular genetics and regulatory mechanisms underlying seed storability and longevity are currently poorly understood. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the molecular regulation and elite new genetically improving varieties responsible for crop seed storability.

## Copy number variants (CNVs) in autism spectrum 
<div style="text-align: justify">
My early publications describe the development of a novel approach to detecting de novo CNVs in Illumina SNP genotyping data and applying this to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) families from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). While de novo CNVs had previously been associated with ASD (Sebat et al. 2007), our analysis of this cohort of 1,124 families, including unaffected siblings, allowed us to clarify the genomic architecture. In turn, this allowed us to develop a statistical approach to evaluating whether specific genomic loci are associated with ASD; four de novo duplications at 7q11.23 met these criteria for ASD association with reduced sociability and, notably, deletions at the same locus are associated with increased social behavior in Williamâ€™s Syndrome. We have recently (2015) published a CNV analysis of all 2,591 families in the SSC. By integrating CNV and exome data we showed that small de novo deletions contain one critical ASD gene, while large de novo CNVs contain multiple ASD risk genes. We use this finding to identify six ASD risk CNV loci and 65 ASD risk genes. I led the analysis and write up of both projects including the development of novel approaches to CNV detection. Autism Speaks cited our 2011 CNV analysis as one of the top Ten Autism Research Achievements.
