# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the Zeng Lab.

## Graduate students



## Postdoctoral researchers

We have more data and research ideas than trainees, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:

- Genomic and functional genomic analysis, including whole-genome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, and integrative analysis of genomic and functional genomic data 
- Statistical analysis
